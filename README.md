# misc_react-quiz

This repository holds my version of [Web Dev Cody's live coding example of a quiz-app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=925ikOIgkis). It was built with `Vite` and is written in `Typescript`.

## Setup

Running the quiz on your localhost:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## To continue

Testing one or more functions of the quiz either using `vitest` or `jest` (to be determined)
